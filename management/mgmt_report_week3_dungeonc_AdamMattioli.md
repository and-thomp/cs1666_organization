**Note: In order for everyone to contribute this week, we did go above and beyond our goals.
I will detail who did what in the Team Member Evaluation Section

## Team member evalution

**Note: I gave most people a 1 because we went above and beyond our goals pretty far.
The people I rated a 0 still contributed sufficiently, but had other time commitments that
prevented them from getting involved past some of the later goals we set for them.
Also, some peoples changes aren't reflected in the commits history since they worked on files
with a group outside of the repo and had one group representative push the file(s). 
(So I still marked everyone as having at least 1 commit)
